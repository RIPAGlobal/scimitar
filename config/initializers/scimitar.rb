# SCIMITAR CONFIGURATION
#
# For supporting information and rationale, please see README.md.

# =============================================================================
# SERVICE PROVIDER CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
#
# This is a Ruby abstraction over a SCIM entity that declares the capabilities
# supported by a particular implementation.
#
# Typically this is used to declare parts of the standard unsupported, if you
# don't need them and don't want to provide subclass support.
#
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Scimitar.service_provider_configuration = Scimitar::ServiceProviderConfiguration.new({

    # See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643#section-8.5 for properties.
    #
    # See Gem source file 'app/models/scimitar/service_provider_configuration.rb'
    # for defaults. Define Hash keys here that override defaults; e.g. to declare
    # that filters are not supported so that calling clients shouldn't use them:
    #
    #   filter: Scimitar::Supported.unsupported

  })

  # =============================================================================
  # ENGINE CONFIGURATION
  # =============================================================================
  #
  # This is where you provide callbacks for things like authorisation or mixins
  # that get included into all Scimitar-derived controllers (for things like
  # before-actions that apply to all Scimitar controller-based routes).
  #
  Scimitar.engine_configuration = Scimitar::EngineConfiguration.new({

    # If you have filters you want to run for any Scimitar action/route, you can
    # define them here. For example, you might use a before-action to set up some
    # multi-tenancy related state, or skip Rails CSRF token verification/
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #     application_controller_mixin: Module.new do
    #       def self.included(base)
    #         base.class_eval do
    #
    #           # Anything here is written just as you'd write it at the top of
    #           # one of your controller classes, but it gets included in all
    #           # Scimitar classes too.
    #
    #           skip_before_action    :verify_authenticity_token
    #           prepend_before_action :setup_some_kind_of_multi_tenancy_data
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end, # ...other configuration entries might follow...

    # If you want to support username/password authentication:
    #
    #     basic_authenticator: Proc.new do | username, password |
    #       # Check username/password and return 'true' if valid, else 'false'.
    #     end, # ...other configuration entries might follow...
    #
    # The 'username' and 'password' parameters come from Rails:
    #
    #   https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Basic.html
    #   https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Basic/ControllerMethods.html#method-i-authenticate_with_http_basic

    # If you want to support HTTP bearer token (OAuth-style) authentication:
    #
    #     token_authenticator: Proc.new do | token, options |
    #       # Check token and return 'true' if valid, else 'false'.
    #     end, # ...other configuration entries might follow...
    #
    # The 'token' and 'options' parameters come from Rails:
    #
    #   https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Token.html
    #   https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Token/ControllerMethods.html#method-i-authenticate_with_http_token
    #
    # Note that both basic and token authentication can be declared, with the
    # parameters in the inbound HTTP request determining which is invoked.

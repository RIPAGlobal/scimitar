# 1.7.1 (2023-11-15)

* Always returns a `Content-Type` header with value `application/scim+json; charset=utf-8` in any response, since that's the only format the gem can write. Fixes [#59](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/59).
* Uses the more common header name form of `WWW-Authenticate` rather than the Rack-like `WWW_AUTHENTICATE` in responses.

# 1.7.0 (2023-11-15)

Features:

* Schema location URLs are generated by the controller, making overrides simpler, via [#71](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/71) - thanks to `s-andringa`
* A block can be passed to `ActiveRecordBackedResourcesController#save!`, making it easier to override with custom behaviour since you won't have to worry about things like uniqueness constraint exceptions, via [#73](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/73) - thanks to `s-andringa`
* Those who want an invariant local testing setup can now consider using Docker via [#77](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/77) - thanks to `@osingaatje`

Fixes:

* Multi-valued simple types are now correctly rendered via [74](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/74) - thanks to `s-andringa`
* Sensitive fields are no longer rendered (fixes [#56](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/56) via [#80](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/80) - thanks to `@kuldeepaggarwal`.

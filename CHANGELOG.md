# 1.11.0 (2024-10-22)

Features:

* Custom controller mixins can now override more of the Scimitar base controller since the inclusion has been moved to the end of the file. This is particularly useful for overriding `rescue_from` declarations. See [#148](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/148) for more - thanks to `@hrtshu`

Fixes:

* The `ResourceTypes` endpoint returned an invalid payload; this is now fixed per RFC 7644 via [#147](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/147) - thanks to `@pbouda`

Other notes:

* `README.md` typo fix via [#145](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/145) - thanks to `@pavelloz`

Gem developer notes:

* Local developer Ruby version (for `rbenv` users, at least) bumped to v3.3.5

# 1.10.0 (2024-06-27)

Features:

* Override which core schema are returned in the `/Schemas` endpoint via new call `Scimitar::Engine::set_default_resources` (see [this code diff](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/133/files#diff-b8ad01f8ed8a88f41a13938505a2050d3d3ff86af93a78a7690b273ece6b80bdR80)) - implements [#118](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/118) requested by `@gsar` via [#133](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/133)
* Opt-in feature to make the `/Schemas` endpoint walk resource attribute maps to determine _actual_ supported attributes and attribute mutability, rather than just reporting the literal schema definition; see the description of the `schema_list_from_attribute_mappings` configuration setting inside the template `config/initializers/scimitar.rb` file for details (or read it via the [code diff here](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/135/files#diff-830211b739a7c7398083b7127d648b356f43d298713a2b3f0c13f2271b9d3c82R110)) - implements [#119](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/119) requested by `@gsar` via [#135](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/135)

Fixes:

* The `/Schemas` endpoint used to return a completely non-complaint response, but now returns a compliant `ListResponse`, as it always should have; there is no major version change to Scimitar with this fix, as it is hoped that this has no impact for most people (surely anyone who had attempted to use the endpoint would have already reported the issue!) - fixes [#117](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/117) via [#133](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/133) - thanks to `@gsar`
* A number of problems with extension schema are fixed so they should work much more reliably now, with `README.md` documentation updated in a few places for clairty; check there if you are still having trouble - fixes [#122](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/122) via [#134](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/134) - thanks to `@easym0de`

Other notes:

* For developers, note that debugging is now via the standard Ruby debugger - use e.g. `debugger` instead of `byebug` if you want to halt code and reach a debugging prompt during development work

# 1.9.0 (unreleased)

Features:

* Supports the [SCIM mechanism for requesting specific attributes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.9) (noting however that schema ID URN prefixes are not supported; use only dotted attribute paths without such prefixes) - closes [89](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/89) via [102](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/102) and [127](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/127) - thanks to `@xjunior`
* In a moment of d√©ja vu from v1.8.3's Microsoft payload workarounds for [123](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/123), handles a different kind of malformed filter sent by Microsoft Azure (Entra) in `GET` requests - implements [115](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/115) requested by `@gsar` via [128](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/128)
* Handles schema IDs (URNs) in filters of `GET` requests - implements [116](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/116) requested by `@gsar` via [131](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/131)

Fixes:

* Corrects schema for `name.givenName` and `name.familyName` in User, which previously specified these as required, but the SCIM specification says they are not - fixes [113](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/113) reported by `@s-andringa` via [129](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/129). If your code somehow _relies_ upon `name.givenName` and/or `name.familyName` being required in the User schema, you can patch this in your `config/initializers/scimitar.rb` file - for example:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
      Scimitar::Schema::Name.scim_attributes.find { |a| a.name == 'familyName' }.required = true
      Scimitar::Schema::Name.scim_attributes.find { |a| a.name == 'givenName'  }.required = true

      # ...
    end
    ```

# 1.8.3 (unreleased)

Features:

* As part of the above fix, schema ID handling was improved and extended with better test coverage. `PATCH` `add` and `replace` operations with `value` objects containing schema IDs both with or without attributes inline should now work reliably.

Fixes:

* Handles what I _think_ are technically malformed payloads from Azure (Entra), but since they seem unavoidable, it's important to handle them - should fix [123](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/123) reported by `@eduardoborba`

# 1.8.2 (2024-03-27)

Fixes:

* The implementation of non-returned SCIM fields turned out to inadvertently prevent their subsequent update (so SCIM _updates_ to e.g. passwords would fail); fixed [105](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/105) and (in passing) [6](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/6), via [109](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/109) - thanks to `@xjunior`
* The case-insensitive, String or Symbol access Hash class documented itself as preserving case but did not, reported in [98](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/98), also via [109](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/109) - thanks to `@s-andringa`

# 1.8.1 (2024-01-16)

Fixes:

* Some dependency chain gems have stopped supporting Ruby 2.7, so a `Gemfile.lock` for local development generated under Ruby 3 does not work under Ruby 2.7. Solved by removing `Gemfile.lock` entirely, so that an errant Nokogiri lock in `scimitar.gemspec` used previously as a workaround could also be removed.

# 1.8.0 (2024-01-15)

Warning:

* The default `type` value of `work` in the `address` complex type has been removed, in line with all other comparable complex types, via [87](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/87) / [92](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/92) - thanks to `@s-andringa`.
* **This is unlikely to break client code but there is a *small* chance of issues if you relied upon the default**. Please check your implementation if at all concerned. It doesn't seem risky enough to force a major version bump to comply with semantic versioning.

Features:

* Allow a block to be passed to `Scimitar::ActiveRecordBackedResourcesController#create`, `#update` and `#replace`. This behaves in a manner analogous to passing a block to `Scimitar::ActiveRecordBackedResourcesController#destroy`, wherein the block implementation becomes responsible for destroying the record the block is given; in the case of `#create`, `#update` and `#replace`, the block is passed the new or updated record and is responsible for persisting it.

Fixes:

* Fix for Microsoft SCIM Validator; pathless `replace` operations can use dot-path notation in the `value` section, via [69](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/69) - thanks to `@wooly`
* Basic and token authentication blocks now operate in the context of the application's controller, via [88](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/88) - thanks to `@tejanium`
* Exception handling for records during saving is improved and extensible, via [91](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/91)

Maintenance:

* Bump local development Ruby to v3.3.0, including it in the test matrix and in effect creating "official" support for that Ruby version.

# 1.7.1 (2023-11-15)

* Always returns a `Content-Type` header with value `application/scim+json; charset=utf-8` in any response, since that's the only format the gem can write. Fixes [#59](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/59).
* Uses the more common header name form of `WWW-Authenticate` rather than the Rack-like `WWW_AUTHENTICATE` in responses.

# 1.7.0 (2023-11-15)

Features:

* Schema location URLs are generated by the controller, making overrides simpler, via [#71](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/71) - thanks to `@s-andringa`
* A block can be passed to `ActiveRecordBackedResourcesController#save!`, making it easier to override with custom behaviour since you won't have to worry about things like uniqueness constraint exceptions, via [#73](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/73) - thanks to `@s-andringa`
* Those who want an invariant local testing setup can now consider using Docker via [#77](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/77) - thanks to `@osingaatje`

Fixes:

* Multi-valued simple types are now correctly rendered via [74](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/74) - thanks to `@s-andringa`
* Sensitive fields are no longer rendered (fixes [#56](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/56) via [#80](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/pull/80) - thanks to `@kuldeepaggarwal`.

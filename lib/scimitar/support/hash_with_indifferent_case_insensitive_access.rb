    # A subclass of ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess where not only
    # can Hash keys be queried as Symbols or Strings, but they are looked up
    # in a case-insensitive fashion too.
    #
    # During enumeration, Hash keys will always be returned in whatever case
    # they were originally set. Just as with
    # ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess, though, the type of the keys is
    # always returned as a String, even if originally set as a Symbol - only
    # the upper/lower case nature of the original key is preserved.
    #
    # If a key is written more than once with the same effective meaning in a
    # to-string, to-downcase form, then whatever case was used *first* wins;
    # e.g. if you did hash['User'] = 23, then hash['USER'] = 42, the result
    # would be {"User" => 42}.
    #
    # It's important to remember that Hash#merge is shallow and replaces values
    # found at existing keys in the target ("this") hash with values in the
    # inbound Hash. If that new value that is itself a Hash, this *replaces*
    # the value. For example:
    #
    # * Original: <tt>'Foo' => { 'Bar' => 42 }</tt>
    # * Merge:    <tt>'FOO' => { 'BAR' => 24 }</tt>
    #
    # ...results in "this" target hash's key +Foo+ being addressed in the merge
    # by inbound key +FOO+, so the case doesn't change. But the value for +Foo+
    # is _replaced_ by the merging-in Hash completely:
    #
    # * Result: <tt>'Foo' => { 'BAR' => 24 }</tt>
    #
    # ...and of course we might've replaced with a totally different type, such
    # as +true+:
    #
    # * Original: <tt>'Foo' => { 'Bar' => 42 }</tt>
    # * Merge:    <tt>'FOO' => true</tt>
    # * Result:   <tt>'Foo' => true</tt>
    #
    # If you're intending to merge nested Hashes, then use ActiveSupport's
    # #deep_merge or an equivalent. This will have the expected outcome, where
    # the hash with 'BAR' is _merged_ into the existing value and, therefore,
    # the original 'Bar' key case is preserved:
    #
    # * Original:   <tt>'Foo' => { 'Bar' => 42 }</tt>
    # * Deep merge: <tt>'FOO' => { 'BAR' => 24 }</tt>
    # * Result:     <tt>'Foo' => { 'Bar' => 24 }</tt>

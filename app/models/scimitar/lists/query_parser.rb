    # Simple SCIM filter support.
    #
    # This is currently an extremely limited query parser supporting only a
    # single "name-operator-value" query, no boolean operations or precedence
    # operators and it assumes "(I)LIKE" and "%" as wildcards in SQL for any
    # operators which require partial match (contains / "co", starts with /
    # "sw", ends with / "ew"). Generic operations don't support "pr" either
    # ('presence').
    #
    # Create an instance, then construct a query appropriate for your storage
    # back-end using #attribute to get the attribute name (in terms of "your
    # data", via your Scimitar::Resources::Mixin-including class implementation
    # of ::scim_queryable_attributes), #operator to get a generic SQL operator
    # such as "=" or "!=" and #parameter to get the value to be found (which
    # you MUST take care to process so as to avoid an SQL injection or similar
    # issues - use escaping suitable for your storage system's query language).
    #
    # * If you don't want to support (I)LIKE just check for it in #parameter's
    #   return value; it'll be upper case.
    #
    # Given the likelihood of using ActiveRecord via Rails, there's a higher
    # level and easier method - just create the instance, then call
    # QueryParser#to_activerecord_query to get a given base scope narrowed down
    # to match the filter parameters.

        # Flattening
        # =====================================================================

        # A depressingly heavyweight method that attempts to partly rationalise
        # some of the simpler cases of filters-in-filters by realising that the
        # expression can be done in two ways.
        #
        # https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#page-23 includes these examples:
        #
        #     filter=userType eq "Employee" and (emails.type eq "work")
        #     filter=userType eq "Employee" and emails[type eq "work" and value co "@example.com"]
        #
        # Ignoring the extra 'and', we can see that using either a nested
        # filter-like path *or* the dotted notation are equivalent here. So, if
        # we were to step along the string looking for an unescaped "[" at the
        # start of an inner filter, we could extract attributes therein and use
        # the part before the "[" as a prefix - "emails[type" to "emails.type",
        # with similar substitutions therein.
        #
        # Further, via https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/scimitar/issues/115 we see
        # a requirement to support a broken form emitted by Microsoft; that is
        # supported herein.
        #
        # This method tries to flatten things thus. It throws exceptions if any
        # problems arise at all. Some limitations:
        #
        # * Inner filters with further complex filters inside will not work.
        # * Spaces immediately after an opening "[" will break the flattener.
        # * 'not' can only be used in the context of 'and not' / 'or not'; it
        #   isn't supported stand-alone at the start of expressions (e.g.
        #   'not userType eq "Employee')
        #
        # Examples:
        #
        #     <- userType eq "Employee" and emails[type eq "work" and value co "@example.com"]
        #     => userType eq "Employee" and emails.type eq "work" and emails.value co "@example.com"
        #
        #     <- emails[type eq "work" and value co "@example.com"] or ims[type eq "xmpp" and value co "@foo.com"]
        #     => emails.type eq "work" and emails.value co "@example.com" or ims.type eq "xmpp" and ims.value co "@foo.com"
        #
        #     <- userType eq "Employee" or userName pr and emails[type eq "with spaces" and value co "@example.com"]
        #     => userType eq "Employee" or userName pr and emails.type eq "with spaces" and emails.value co "@example.com"
        #
        #     <- userType ne "Employee" and not (emails[value co "example.com" or (value co "example.org")]) and userName="foo"
        #     => userType ne "Employee" and not (emails.value co "example.com" or (emails.value co "example.org")) and userName="foo"
        #
        #     <- emails[type eq "work"].value eq "foo@bar.com"   (Microsoft workaround)
        #     => emails.type eq "work" and emails.value eq "foo@bar.com"

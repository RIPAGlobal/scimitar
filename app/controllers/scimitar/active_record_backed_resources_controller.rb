module Scimitar

  # An ActiveRecord-centric subclass of Scimitar::ResourcesController. See that
  # class's documentation first, as it describes things that your subclass must
  # do which apply equally to subclasses of this ActiveRecord-focused code.
  #
  # In addition to requirements mentioned above, your subclass MUST override
  # protected method #storage_scope, returning an ActiveRecord::Relation which
  # is used as a starting scope for any 'index' (list) views. This gives you an
  # opportunity to apply things like is-active filters, apply soft deletion
  # scopes, apply security scopes and so-on. For example:
  #
  #     protected
  #       def storage_scope
  #         self.storage_class().where(is_deleted: false)
  #       end
  #

    #
    # ...i.e. the standard delete-record-with-callbacks method. If you pass
    # a block, then this block is invoked and passed the ActiveRecord model
    # instance to be destroyed. You can then do things like soft-deletions,
    # updating an "active" flag, perform audit-related operations and so-on.

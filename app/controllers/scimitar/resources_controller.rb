module Scimitar

  # A Rails controller which is mostly idiomatic, with #index, #show, #create
  # and #destroy methods mapping to the conventional HTTP methods in Rails.
  # The #update method is used for partial-update PATCH calls, while the
  # #replace method is used for whole-update PUT calls.
  #
  # Subclass this controller to deal with resource-specific API calls, for
  # endpoints such as Users and Groups. Any one controller is assumed to be
  # related to one class in your application which has mixed in
  # Scimitar::Resources::Mixin. Your subclass MUST override protected method
  # #storage_class, which returns that class. For example, if you had a class
  # User with the mixin included, then:
  #
  #     protected
  #       def storage_class
  #         User
  #       end
  #
  # ...is sufficient.
  #
  # The controller makes no assumptions about storage method - it does not have
  # any ActiveRecord specialisations, for example. If you do use ActiveRecord,
  # consider subclassing Scimitar::ActiveRecordBackedResourcesController
  # instead as it does most of the mapping, persistence and error handling work
  # for you.
  #

    # GET (list)
    #
    # Pass a Scimitar::Lists::Count object providing pagination data along with
    # a page of results in "your" data domain as an Enumerable, along with a
    # block. Renders as "list" result by calling your block with each of the
    # results, allowing you to use something like
    # Scimitar::Resources::Mixin#to_scim to convert to a SCIM representation.
    #
    # +pagination_info+:: A Scimitar::Lists::Count instance with #total set.
    #                     See e.g. protected method #scim_pagination_info to
    #                     assist with this.
